                James (Jim) Charles Wodke, Jr., was called to his eternal home with the Lord on August 18th, 2022.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">

                Jim was born to Dorothy (Garrett) and James (Jake) Wodke Sr. on January 12th, 1945, in Council Grove,
                Kansas.
                They lived there until he was in the 1st grade, when the family moved to Herington, Kansas.
            </p>

            <p class="flow-text">
                At 17, he married Diana Dix, and they had four children from that union.
                In Herington, Jim worked for the Rock Island Railroad.
                When he realized the Rock Island had no future, he moved his family to Alliance, Nebraska.
                He spent several years working on the BNSF Railroad, where he also enjoyed serving as Local Chairman for
                several years.
            </p>

            <p class="flow-text">
                In 1990, Jim married Linda Freiberger and, from that union, they had one child.
                In 1992, he made a career change, becoming an investigator for Yeager Law firm specializing in FELA Law.
                In 1996, his career took him and his family to Loveland, CO.
                In time, he switched to The Rossi Vucinovich Law firm and was most recently working as a lead
                investigator.
            </p>

            <p class="flow-text">
                Jim enjoyed his family, home brewing, riding his Harley, dining at restaurants, and spending time on his
                iPad.
